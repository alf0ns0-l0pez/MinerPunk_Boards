## Introduction
**MinerPunk** is a opensource project designed to unite part of the two worlds electronics and software and in this repository you will find everything about our entire catalog of boards.

## Usage
If you want to use any of our boards you have to connect via usb to a computer in **GNU/Linux, Windows OS or Mac OS**, which will be detected as **SerialPort** and through commands you can interact with them.

There are two ways to send and receive messages to our boards.

1. Communicating directly to the Board with your own code or a terminal like PuTTY using the Set Instructions corresponding to each model, for example.
